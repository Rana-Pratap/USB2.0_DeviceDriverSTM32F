### Before USB 

Before USB (Universal Serial Bus) became a widely adopted standard for device connectivity, various other communication interfaces were used to connect peripherals and devices to computers. These interfaces were often specific to certain types of devices and had limited capabilities compared to USB. Some of the prominent communication interfaces before USB include:

    Serial Port (RS-232): The serial port, also known as RS-232, was a widely used communication interface for connecting devices like modems, printers, and mice to computers. It used a serial data transmission format, transferring data one bit at a time, and required a dedicated serial port on the computer.

    Parallel Port (Centronics): The parallel port, commonly referred to as Centronics, allowed for parallel data transmission and was used primarily for connecting printers. It transmitted multiple bits simultaneously and required a specialized parallel port on the computer.

    PS/2 Port: The PS/2 port was commonly used for connecting keyboards and mice to computers. It was a round, six-pin connector with separate ports for the keyboard and mouse.

    SCSI (Small Computer System Interface): SCSI was a high-speed interface primarily used for connecting external storage devices, such as hard drives and CD/DVD-ROM drives. It provided fast data transfer rates but required specialized hardware and additional controller cards.

    MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface): MIDI was a standard for connecting musical instruments and equipment to computers for music production and recording. It transmitted musical data rather than general data like USB.

    ADB (Apple Desktop Bus): ADB was an interface used by Apple computers for connecting keyboards, mice, and other peripherals. It was specific to Apple devices and computers.

    Game Ports: Game ports were used for connecting joysticks and game controllers to computers. They were common in early personal computers for gaming purposes.

    FireWire (IEEE 1394): FireWire was a high-speed interface similar to USB, primarily used for connecting digital cameras, camcorders, and external hard drives. It offered faster data transfer rates than USB but was less common in non-multimedia devices.

While these interfaces served their specific purposes, they lacked the universality and ease of use that USB brought to device connectivity. Each peripheral type often required its own dedicated port, and connecting and disconnecting devices could be cumbersome. With the introduction of USB, the technology landscape changed significantly, offering a standardized, versatile, and user-friendly interface for connecting a wide range of devices to computers.
